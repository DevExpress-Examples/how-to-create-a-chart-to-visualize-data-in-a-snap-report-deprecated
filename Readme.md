# How to create a chart to visualize data in a Snap report

> **Note**
>
> As you may already know, the [WinForms Snap control](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/11373/controls-and-libraries/snap) and [Snap Report API](https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/15188/snap-report-api) are now in maintenance support mode. No new features or capabilities are incorporated into these products. We recommend that you use [DevExpress Reporting](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/2162/reporting) tool to generate, edit, print, and export your business reports/documents.

This example demonstrates how to use the **Snap Chart API** to add a chart to a report document programmatically.

Use the **SnapDocument.CreateSnChart** method to insert a chart into a document. This method returns the [SnapChart](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.Snap.Core.API.SnapChart?v=21.2) object, which represents the newly created chart and provides properties used to populate the chart with data and fine-tune its layout and appearance settings.Â 
Use theÂ [SnapChart.DataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.Snap.Core.API.SnapChart.DataSource?v=21.2) property to bind the chart to data.  
To provide data to the chart series, assign the data field containing series names to theÂ [SnapChart.SeriesDataMember](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.Snap.Core.API.SnapChart.SeriesDataMember?v=21.2) property and specify the argument and value data members of the [SeriesBase](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraCharts.SeriesBase) object returned by theÂ [SnapChart.SeriesTemplate](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.Snap.Core.API.SnapChart.SeriesTemplate?v=21.2) property.
